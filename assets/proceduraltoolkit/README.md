# Procedural Toolkit v0.1.5

Procedural Toolkit is a collection of instruments for creating procedural generation systems. It is free, open source and does not require a Unity Pro license.

**Warning: Be aware that this is a programming toolkit, editor support is limited.**

## Classes
* RandomE: Random extensions for arrays, value generators.
* MeshE: Mesh extensions and constructors for primitives.
* MeshDraft: helper class for procedural mesh generation.
* TextureE: Texture extensions and constructors.
* ColorE: Color extensions, HTML colors.
* PTUtils: useful utility methods.
* Datasets: various data.

## Editor classes
* ProceduralToolkitMenu: constructors for primitives and about window.
* MeshFilterExtension: Mesh saver.

## Examples
* [Khrushchyovka](http://syomus.com/ProceduralToolkit/Khrushchyovka.html): a procedural building generator.
* [ChairGenerator](http://syomus.com/ProceduralToolkit/ChairGenerator.html): a procedural chair generator.
* [Boids](http://syomus.com/ProceduralToolkit/Boids.html): a single-mesh particle system with birds-like behaviour.
* [Breakout](http://syomus.com/ProceduralToolkit/Breakout.html): a Breakout clone with procedurally generated levels.
* [TerrainMesh](http://syomus.com/ProceduralToolkit/TerrainMesh.html): a simple terrain based on Perlin noise and coloured according to height.
* [Mazes](http://syomus.com/ProceduralToolkit/Mazes.html): a maze generators.
* [Primitives](http://syomus.com/ProceduralToolkit/Primitives.html): a demonstration of primitives.
